## 🚀 What You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### Option 1: Start Training (Recommended)

**Tomorrow morning (1-2 hours):**

```bash
# 1. Package project
python prepare_for_colab.py

# 2. Upload to Google Drive
# Upload the created folder to: MyDrive/sepsis_rl_project/

# 3. Open Colab
# Open: colab_notebooks/01_Setup_and_Baseline_Evaluation.ipynb
# Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Select: GPU (A100 if available)
# Run all cells

# 4. Continue to BC training
# Open: colab_notebooks/02_Train_BC_Behavior_Cloning.ipynb
# Run all cells
```

**Expected Results:**
- Baseline survival rates (Random vs Heuristic)
- BC model trained and evaluated
- First comparison plots
- Concrete data for paper!

**Total Time:** ~1.5-2 hours

### Option 2: Run All Notebooks in Sequence

**Days 2-5 (total ~6-8 hours):**

1. Notebook 1: Baselines (~30 min)
2. Notebook 2: BC (~45 min)
3. Notebook 3: CQL (~1-2 hours)
4. Notebook 4: DQN (~1-2 hours)
5. Notebook 5: Reward comparison (~2-3 hours)
6. Notebook 6: Visualizations (~30 min)
7. Notebook 7: Final analysis (~30 min)

**Then:** Start writing paper (Days 6-13)

## 🎓 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Three Reward Function Variants

```python
# Simple: Terminal only
reward = ±15 if done else 0

# Paper (Raghu et al. 2017): Continuous feedback
reward = C0·1(SOFA unchanged) + C1·ΔSOFA + C2·tanh(Δlactate)

# Hybrid: Balanced approach
reward = 0.1 × paper_reward (intermediate) + ±15 (terminal)
```

### 2. SOFA-Stratified Evaluation

- **Low SOFA (<5):** Less severe patients
- **Medium SOFA (5-15):** Moderate severity
- **High SOFA (>15):** Critical patients

Provides clinical interpretability and fairness analysis.

### 3. Five Policy Comparison

1. **Random:** Baseline
2. **Heuristic:** Clinical rules
3. **BC:** Supervised learning
4. **CQL:** Conservative offline RL
5. **DQN:** Online RL with exploration

### 4. Publication-Ready Visualization

- Policy heatmaps (action distribution)
- Mortality vs dosage deviation
- Training curves
- SOFA-stratified comparisons
- Algorithm comparisons
- Episode length analysis
- Reward function impact

All 300 DPI, ready for JASA submission.
