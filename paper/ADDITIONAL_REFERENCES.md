## üìù How to Cite in Paper

### **Methods Section - Baseline Policies:**

> "**Baseline Policies.** We evaluate two baseline policies: (1) a random policy selecting actions uniformly, and (2) a heuristic policy implementing clinical decision rules based on Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines \\cite{rhodes2017ssc}. The heuristic uses threshold-based rules derived from established clinical criteria \\cite{seymour2017sepsis_criteria}, escalating treatment based on blood pressure, lactate levels, and SOFA scores. Such rule-based approaches represent classical expert systems in medicine \\cite{shortliffe1976mycin} and provide an interpretable baseline for comparison."

### **Methods Section - Reward Functions:**

> "**Reward Function Design.** We compare three reward formulations:
>
> (1) **Simple reward**: Sparse terminal reward only (¬±15 based on survival), providing a clear optimization objective but limited learning signal.
>
> (2) **Paper reward** \\cite{raghu2017sepsis_drl}: Dense intermediate rewards based on SOFA and lactate changes, offering continuous feedback but potentially overweighting short-term clinical markers.
>
> (3) **Hybrid reward**: A weighted combination of intermediate clinical feedback and terminal outcomes, following reward shaping principles \\cite{ng1999reward_shaping,brys2014multi_objective_shaping}. Specifically, we scale the paper reward by Œ±=0.1 for intermediate steps while maintaining full terminal rewards (¬±15), balancing immediate guidance with long-term outcome emphasis. This approach addresses the challenge of multi-objective optimization in medical RL, where both intermediate clinical improvements and ultimate patient survival are important \\cite{yu2021rl_healthcare}."
