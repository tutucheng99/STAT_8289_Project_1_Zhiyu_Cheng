   - Edit line 94 in main.tex
   - Replace "Your Name" with your actual name

   - Change line 78 in main.tex from "\newcommand{\anon}{1}" to "\newcommand{\anon}{0}"

3. Add figures:
   - Upload figure files to Overleaf
   - Use \includegraphics{filename} in section files

4. Modify sections:
   - Edit individual .tex files in the sections/ folder

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "File not found" errors
Solution: Check that section files are in a "sections/" subdirectory

Problem: Bibliography not showing
Solution:
  1. Compile with pdfLaTeX
  2. Run BibTeX
  3. Compile with pdfLaTeX again (twice)
  Overleaf usually does this automatically.

Problem: References showing as [?]
Solution: Compile multiple times to resolve cross-references

Problem: Encoding errors with special characters
Solution: The document uses UTF-8 encoding and should work by default in Overleaf

================================================================================
SUPPORT
