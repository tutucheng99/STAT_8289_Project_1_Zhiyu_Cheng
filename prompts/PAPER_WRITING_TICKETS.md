## Risk Management

### High Risk Issues:
1. **Page limit overflow (25 pages)**
   - Mitigation: Built-in trim strategy (Ticket 5.2)
   - Supplementary materials option available

2. **Time constraint (11 days remaining)**
   - Mitigation: Detailed timeline with buffers
   - Core content prioritized (Results section protected)

3. **Citation completeness (20-25 papers needed)**
   - Mitigation: Start Ticket 5.1 early
   - Use reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley)

### Medium Risk Issues:
1. **Figure quality/formatting**
   - Mitigation: Figures already generated, just need captions
   - 300 DPI verified

2. **JASA formatting compliance**
   - Mitigation: Template available, checklist detailed

3. **Technical accuracy verification**
   - Mitigation: All numbers in FINAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.txt
   - Cross-check during proofreading

### Low Risk Issues:
1. **Code submission**
   - Mitigation: Code already exists, just needs packaging

2. **Email submission mechanics**
   - Mitigation: Template provided, test email in advance

## Notes & Reminders

1. **Core Message:** CQL achieves comparable performance (88.5% high SOFA survival) WITH 600x stronger interpretability than DQN. Performance-interpretability trade-off is not inevitable.

2. **Key Numbers to Remember:**
   - CQL max saliency: -40.06 (SysBP)
   - DQN max saliency: 0.069 (INR)
   - Interpretability advantage: 600x
   - High SOFA survival: CQL 88.5%, DQN 84.3%, Random 88.4%
   - All methods overall: 94.0-95.0%

3. **Critical Files:**
   - Data source: `results/FINAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.txt`
   - Core figure: `results/figures/leg_interpretability_comparison.png`
   - Project requirements: `prompts/STAT 8289 RL project.pdf`
   - Paper outline: `prompts/PAPER_OUTLINE_AND_BUDGET.md`

4. **Writing Principles:**
   - Interpretability is not optional - it's required for deployment
   - Let the data speak - minimize speculation
   - Acknowledge limitations honestly
   - Connect findings to clinical practice explicitly

5. **Quality Criteria (from course requirements):**
   - Structure of the paper ✓ (outline ready)
   - Writing quality (grammar, clarity)
   - Appropriate use and evaluation of approach
   - Clarity of figures and tables
   - Appropriateness of abstract and keywords
   - Quality of discussion and conclusions
   - Adequacy of references
