### 6. Discussion (3-4 pages)

#### 6.1 Main Findings (0.75 pages)
- Recap: All algorithms achieve similar performance (94-95%)
- Critical distinction: interpretability varies dramatically (600x)
- CQL breaks the assumed performance-interpretability trade-off

#### 6.2 Why CQL Achieves Superior Interpretability (1 page)
- **Theoretical explanation:**
  - Conservative value estimation prevents overestimation
  - Pessimism → stay closer to behavioral policy
  - Q-value learning captures value differences explicitly
  - Linear decision boundaries in high-value regions
- **Comparison to BC:**
  - BC learns action probabilities (distributional match)
  - Doesn't distinguish high-value vs low-value actions clearly
  - State-dependent interpretability reflects data quality
- **Comparison to DQN:**
  - DQN trained online, then applied offline (distribution mismatch)
  - Deep Q-network learns complex non-linear representations
  - No conservative penalty → relies on capacity for generalization

#### 6.3 Clinical Implications (1 page)
- **Regulatory approval pathway:**
  - FDA guidelines require explainability for clinical AI
  - CQL's interpretability enables human oversight
  - Strong feature signals allow domain expert validation
- **Trust and adoption:**
  - Clinicians more likely to trust interpretable systems
  - CQL's blood pressure + lactate rules align with training
  - Facilitates debugging and refinement
- **Patient safety:**
  - Interpretability enables anomaly detection
  - Can identify when model is uncertain
  - Human-in-the-loop decision support

#### 6.4 Limitations (0.75 pages)
- **Sample size:**
  - 10 states per algorithm (could expand to 30 with stratification)
  - Patterns highly consistent, but more states would strengthen claims
- **Simulation environment:**
  - Gym-Sepsis is trained on MIMIC-III (observational data)
  - Real-world validation needed before deployment
  - Simulator may not capture all clinical complexities
- **LEG method:**
  - Perturbation-based (local approximation)
  - Linear approximation may not capture non-linear interactions
  - Alternative methods (SHAP, LIME) could complement findings
- **Generalizability:**
  - Single disease domain (sepsis)
  - Findings may not extend to all medical RL applications
  - Need studies in other clinical domains

#### 6.5 Future Work (0.5 pages)
- Expand LEG analysis to 30 states with SOFA stratification
- Prospective clinical trial simulation
- Investigate CQL variants (discrete CQL, munchausen CQL)
- Compare with other interpretability methods (SHAP, attention)
- Real-world pilot study with clinician feedback
- Multi-center validation
